## Assignment 4: Gomoku Solver 

For CMPUT 355 assignment 4, we will be implementing a solver for the game `Gomoku`. 

### Gomoku Rules: 
1. The game is played on a 15 by 15 go board by two players (black and white).
2. There are three possible states for each position on the board: black, white or empty.
3. Black plays first, then white. This repeats until a player wins. 
4. To win the game, a player must place 5 stones next to each other horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
