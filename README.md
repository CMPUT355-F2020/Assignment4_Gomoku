`Team Members (in alphabetical order): Rehab El-Hajj, Helen Trinh, Sadipath Nath, Heeba Parvez, Linhao Xian`

For CMPUT 355 assignment 4, we will be implementing a solver for the game `Gomoku`. 

A YouTube video showing our player in action can be found [here]().

## Gomoku Rules: 
1. The game is played on a 15 by 15 go board by two players (black and white).
2. There are three possible states for each position on the board: black, white or empty.
3. Black plays first, then white. This repeats until a player wins. 
4. To win the game, a player must place 5 stones next to each other horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

## Python modules needed to run code:

## How to run code:

1. Clone the repository 
2. Ensure you have all the required python modules installed (they are listed above)
